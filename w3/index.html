    <h1>Let's calculate your Carbon Footprint!</h1>
    <h2>(This is a work in progress. So far, we only check Household Size and Home Size.)</h2>

    <fieldset>
        <legend>Household Size:</legend>
        <div>
            <!--
                The magic here is in the "oninput" attribute. Any element with this attribute set will call
                the named JavaScript function every time its input changes. For a textbox like this one,
                that means it is called for every character the user types!

                Notice the use of this.value as the argument. For those of you familiar with object oriented
                programming, it means exactly what you think it means. For those of you who are not, then
                maybe we will learn it later in this class, but the short answer is that it passes the current
                text contained in the textbox to our function.
            -->
            <input type="text" id="textHouseholdSize" name="household" oninput="determineHouseholdPts(this.value)" />
            <label for="textHouseholdSize">Type in how many people are in your household (including yourself)?</label>
        </div>
    </fieldset>

    <!--
        Notice that this "oninput" is at the fieldset level. This makes it trigger on a change to any of
        the radio buttons within this fieldset, so we don't have to add it to every single radio button
        individually.

    <!--
        Here we place the field where we want to update the running total CF into a <div> with
        its own ID so that we can reference it easily using document.getElementById("cfTotalField")
        which you'll find in the displayTotalCF() function.
